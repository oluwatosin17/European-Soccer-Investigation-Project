# European-Soccer-Investigation-Project

## Project Details

**Introduction**

- For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
Step One - Choose Your Data Set

## Choose Your Data Set
- The database I picked is a soccer database provided by Kaggle. It contains information about soccer matches, players, and teams from a variety of European countries from 2008 to 2016. For this project, I will be analyzing data from European Professional Football matches and teams from 2008 to 2016. The information was downloaded in SQLite format.

- Questions:
  - What are the top ten teams with the most wins from 2008 to 2016 
  - What are the top ten teams with the most wins in the 2011/2012 season 
  - What is the trend of top 5 match winners in england between 2008 and 2016
  - What is the average number of goals scored in each league per season
  - What are the top 10 players with the highest overall rating ?
  - What are the attributes that contribute to the players' overall rating?
  - What is the ratings of the top 5 most rated player over the period of 2008 to 2015
  - What team attributes lead to the most victories?


## Analyze Your Data

Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options to help you get started. Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

## Share your findings

Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. If you use a Jupyter notebook, share your findings alongside the code you used to perform the analysis. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. You should also feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.
